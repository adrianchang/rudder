Rudder is an offline to online dating app. Imagine this, when you are chilling in a cafe and you see an attractive person sitting over there. If you have Rudder installed on your phone, you can just open the app and he or she might be on the nearby user list. And you can then interact with her. Also by using Bluetooth Low Energy, we can get real nearby users in the same room, not just people in the near 1km.

The first mode is Bragging mode, which also the user to show off themselves so other users can scan them if they are near them. The other mode is Discrete mode, which the user will not be scan by other people. As you can see, they are pros and cons of different mode, the users can choose base on their preferences.

# How it actually works

Rudder is using bluetooth low energy to scan the user around it and use firebase as database. Bluetooth low energy is a new technology for mobile phone which consume less energy. Thus the user can turn on bluetooth low energy for a long time. Also Rudder is build on Cordova, which enables it to run on both android and ios platform.
